How do I resolve npm error

_**Assistant**_

The error message you're encountering indicates that `npm` is unable to find the `package.json` file in your project directory. This file is essential for managing your project's dependencies and scripts. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check for `package.json`:** 
   - Navigate to your project directory (`/Users/donlee/Desktop/Hapa_TaskManager`) and check if the `package.json` file exists. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     ls /Users/donlee/Desktop/Hapa_TaskManager
     ```

2. **Create a `package.json` file:**
   - If the `package.json` file does not exist, you can create one by running:
     ```bash
     npm init
     ```
   - This command will prompt you to enter details about your project and will generate a `package.json` file.

3. **Restore from Version Control:**
   - If you are using version control (like Git), check if the `package.json` file was accidentally deleted. You can restore it from your repository.

4. **Check for Typos:**
   - Ensure that you are in the correct directory and that there are no typos in the path.

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Once you have the `package.json` file in place, you can install your dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please let me know!
