- **Privacy-First Approach**: Local-first data storage with user control
- **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive task details including DIDs, timestamps, and votes
- **Comment System**: Threaded discussions on tasks with @mentions
- **Flowchart Integration**: Future connectivity with Hapa Flowchart App
- **μCredit Integration**: Economic incentives for task completion

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + JSX
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Initial Storage**: Local storage / IndexedDB
- **Future Storage**: Hypercore / Hyperbee decentralized storage
- **Authentication**: DID-based identity
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
