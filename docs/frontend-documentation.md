# Frontend Documentation - Hapa Task Manager

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the frontend architecture, UI components, and state management approach for the Hapa Task Manager application. The frontend is designed to provide an intuitive, responsive, and accessible interface for managing tasks within the Hapa ecosystem.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Core Technologies
- **Framework**: React.js
- **JavaScript Extension**: JSX
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (or Vite for faster development)

### 2.2 Styling Approach
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Component Library**: Custom components inspired by Material Design principles
- **Theming**: Support for light/dark mode and customizable color schemes

### 2.3 State Management
- **Local State**: React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Context API for application-wide state (authentication, settings)
- **Form State**: Formik or React Hook Form for form management
- **Future Integration**: Preparation for Redux or Zustand when backend integration occurs

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 TaskList Component
- Displays tasks in a sortable, filterable list
- Time-ordered by default (newest first)
- Supports filtering by status, category, and assignment
- Infinite scrolling or pagination for performance
- Quick-action buttons for common operations

#### 3.2.2 TaskDetail Component
- Shows comprehensive information about a selected task
- Displays all metadata (creator, timestamps, DIDs)
- Shows voting status and history
- Provides access to the comment thread
- Includes action buttons for updating status

#### 3.2.3 TaskForm Component
- Form for creating and editing tasks
- Input validation and error handling
- Rich text editor for descriptions
- Metadata field auto-population
- Submit for Consul voting option

#### 3.2.4 VotingPanel Component
- Displays current voting status for a task
- Shows which Consul members have voted
- Allows members to cast their votes
- Shows resulting decision when voting completes

#### 3.2.5 TaskComments Component
- Threaded comments on tasks
- Markdown support for rich text formatting
- @mentions for notifying users
- Timestamp and author information for each comment

## 4. UI/UX Design

### 4.1 Design Principles
- **Privacy-First**: No visual indicators of centralized services
- **Decentralized Ethos**: UI language that emphasizes user ownership
- **Minimalist**: Clean, focused interface without unnecessary elements
- **Contextual**: Controls appear when and where they're needed
- **Consistent**: Predictable patterns throughout the application

### 4.2 Layout Strategy
- Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices
- Sidebar for navigation and filters
- Main content area for task lists and details
- Modal dialogs for focused creation/editing
- Collapsible panels for additional information

### 4.3 Visual Elements
- **Color System**: 
  - Primary: Hapa brand colors
  - Secondary: Status indicators (pending, approved, in-progress, completed)
  - Neutral: Background and text hierarchies
- **Typography**:
  - Sans-serif font for readability
  - Clear hierarchy with 3-4 text sizes
  - Monospace for DID displays and technical metadata
- **Icons**:
  - Consistent iconography for actions and states
  - Badge indicators for notifications and counts
  - Custom icons for Hapa-specific concepts (Consul, μCredits)

### 4.4 Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance targeted
- Keyboard navigation throughout the application
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- High contrast mode option
- Screen reader compatible components

## 5. State Management

### 5.1 Local Component State
- Form input states
- UI toggle states (expanded/collapsed)
- Component-specific loading states

### 5.2 Application State
- Current user information and authentication status
- Active task selection
- Filter and sort preferences
- Notification states

### 5.3 Data Flow Patterns
- Unidirectional data flow following React principles
- Props for passing data down the component tree
- Callbacks for passing data up the component tree
- Context for cross-cutting concerns

### 5.4 Future Considerations
- Preparation for offline-first capabilities
- State persistence for session recovery
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

## 6. Interaction Patterns

### 6.1 Task Management
- Drag-and-drop for priority reordering
- Swipe actions on mobile for quick status updates
- Multi-select for batch operations
- Context menus for additional actions

### 6.2 Voting Mechanics
- Simple approve/reject voting UI
- Real-time updates of voting status
- Visual indicators of consensus thresholds
- Voting history and audit trail

### 6.3 Comments and Collaboration
- Inline comment composer
- @mention autocomplete
- Reply threading with collapsible threads
- Comment editing with version history

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Rendering Optimization
- Component memoization (React.memo, useMemo)
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Lazy loading of secondary content
- Code splitting for route-based component loading

### 7.2 Resource Management
- Optimized asset loading
- Image lazy loading and compression
- Font subsetting for faster loading
- Caching strategies for static assets

### 7.3 Responsiveness
- Debounced inputs for search and filtering
- Throttled event handlers for window resizing
- Skeleton loading states for perceived performance
- Progressive enhancement for core functionality

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1 Future Backend Integration
- API client structure ready for backend services
- Environment-based configuration for endpoints
- Authentication token management
- Request/response interceptors for common processing

### 8.2 Flowchart Application
- Component interfaces for flowchart node data
- Visual indicators for tasks linked to flowchart nodes
- Navigation hooks between applications
- Shared styling and component library

### 8.3 Hapa Ecosystem
- Integration points for Gatekeeper AI
- μCredit display and transaction interfaces
- DID integration for user identification
- Hypercore data structure compatibility
