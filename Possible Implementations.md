### **Integrated Connection Strategies for Task Manager & Flowchart App in Hapa**  
To create seamless synergy between the two apps while leveraging Hapa‚Äôs decentralized, AI-driven infrastructure, here are key integration methods:  

---

#### **1. Flowchart-to-Task Automation**  
**Mechanism:**  
- **AI-Powered Node Parsing**: Gatekeeper scans flowcharts stored in **Tier-2 Hyperbee** for nodes tagged as ‚Äúactionable‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúüîß Build API‚Äù or ‚Äú‚úÖ Review Design‚Äù).  
- **Auto-Task Creation**: Triggers `/task.create` RPC (Rainbow-Wave) to mint tasks in **Tier-1 Hypercore feeds**, with metadata linking to the flowchart node.  
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to flowchart nodes (e.g., deadlines, dependencies) auto-update linked tasks via **Merkle tree versioning**.  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- Use **Llama.cpp** locally to classify nodes and generate task parameters.  
- Store task-flowchart mappings in **Consul vaults (Hyperbee)** for auditability.  

---

#### **2. Task-Driven Flowchart Updates**  
**Mechanism:**  
- **Task Progress Visualization**: When a task reaches 50%/100% completion, its linked flowchart node updates color/style (e.g., green for ‚Äúdone‚Äù).  
- **Consul Voting for Edits**: Major diagram changes (e.g., adding/removing nodes post-task) require 2/3 Consul approval via **Hypercore-signed votes**.  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- Sync task statuses via **WebRTC data channels** using Rainbow-Wave headers (e.g., `üêù` for task updates).  
- Render updates in the flowchart UI using **Canvas/WebGL** with versioned Hyperbee snapshots.  

---

#### **3. AI-Optimized Workflows**  
**Mechanism:**  
- **Gatekeeper Suggestions**: Local LLM analyzes both tasks and flowcharts to:  
  - Flag resource conflicts (e.g., ‚ÄúTask X requires Rose credits, but Consul balance is low‚Äù).  
  - Recommend task prioritization based on flowchart dependencies.  
- **Distributed Compute for Complex Layouts**: Route optimization tasks (e.g., Gantt chart generation) to **Mesh Workers** (paid in Rose credits).  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- Train Gatekeeper on Consul‚Äôs historical task/diagram data (stored locally).  
- Use **Valuation-AI oracle** to price compute-heavy flowchart refinements.  

---

#### **4. Crypto-Economic Incentive Alignment**  
**Mechanism:**  
- **Task Completion Rewards**: ŒºCredits minted when Consul approves tasks are split:  
  - 70% to members ‚Üí proportional to flowchart contributions (e.g., nodes created/edited).  
  - 20% to auditors ‚Üí for verifying task-flowchart alignment.  
- **Flowchart Staking**: Consuls stake Bananas to ‚Äúlock‚Äù critical diagrams, earning ŒºCredits for maintaining them.  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- Track contributions via **Hypercore feeds** (tasks) + **Hyperbee edit logs** (flowcharts).  
- Use **Rainbow-Wave‚Äôs ‚Ü©Ô∏è undo headers** to revert fraudulent claims.  

---

#### **5. Governance-Driven Collaboration**  
**Mechanism:**  
- **Consul Voting for Cross-App Changes**:  
  - Example: Adding a new flowchart template that auto-generates task templates requires 2/3 vote.  
  - Votes stored in **Tier-1 feeds** with cryptographic signatures.  
- **Task/Flowchart Permissions**: Restrict edits to Consul members or whitelisted DIDs.  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- Extend the existing Consul voting UI to include flowchart-specific proposals.  
- Use **DID-based signatures** to enforce permissions.

### **Implementation Roadmap**  
1. **Phase 1 (1-3 months):**  
   - Build basic flowchart-node-to-task RPC bridge.  
   - Add task status visualization in flowcharts via WebRTC sync.  
2. **Phase 2 (3-6 months):**  
   - Integrate Gatekeeper AI for dependency analysis.  
   - Implement ŒºCredit rewards tied to flowchart edits.  
3. **Phase 3 (6-12 months):**  
   - Deploy Mesh Worker integration for AI-driven diagram optimization.  
   - Add Bananas staking for critical flowcharts.

### **Key Advantages**  
- **Decentralized Sync**: No central server‚Äîupdates use P2P Hypercore/WebRTC.  
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Gatekeeper processes data locally; only hashes are shared.  
- **Crypto-Aligned**: Incentivizes quality contributions via ŒºCredits/Roses.  
- **Consul-Centric**: All connections require or enrich Consul collaboration.  

By embedding these connections, Hapa‚Äôs Task Manager and Flowchart app become a unified **decentralized project suite**, uniquely positioned to compete with centralized tools through privacy, AI, and crypto-economic innovation.



**Decision made:**
It seems the most reasonable to build a flowchart for each task. Each task will come with a set of supplementary data such as DIDs for the users involved in the task, how the decision was made, votes, timestamp, sources, etc. Based on that, creating a detailed flowchart for the workflow in order to achieve the task goal will be ideal.
Now, based on our conversation, build a list of comprehensive requirement documentations for the task manager app (that will be combined with the Hapa flowchart app afterwards), and summarized contents for each requirement document (such as research overview, product requirement, design brief, and etc.)
