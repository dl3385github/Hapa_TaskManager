#### **4. Technical Specification Document**  
**Purpose:** Detail architecture, protocols, and integration points.  
**Contents:**  
- **System Architecture**:  
  - Frontend: Electron + React (task lists, voting UI).  
  - Backend: Hypercore for task feeds, Hyperbee for Flowchart versioning.  
- **APIs & Protocols**:  
  - `/task.create` RPC (Rainbow-Wave packet structure).  
  - WebRTC data channels for real-time Flowchart sync.  
- **Data Models**:  
  - Task schema (DIDs, timestamps, vote hashes, μCredit allocation).  
  - Flowchart node schema (Merkle tree IDs, task linkages).  
- **Security**:  
  - Ed25519 signatures for Consul votes, AES-256-GCM encryption.  

---

#### **5. Testing & Validation Plan**  
**Purpose:** Ensure functionality, security, and performance.  
**Contents:**  
- **Test Cases**:  
  - Task creation → Hypercore feed update → Flowchart node linkage.  
  - Consul voting → μCredit distribution → audit trail verification.  
- **Security Testing**:  
  - Penetration testing for Hypercore feeds and encrypted channels.  
  - Consensus attack simulations (e.g., fake votes).  
- **Performance Testing**:  
  - Load testing for 1,000+ concurrent tasks.  
  - Local AI inference latency benchmarks.  

---

#### **6. Crypto-Economic Model Document**  
**Purpose:** Define token flows, incentives, and governance.  
**Contents:**  
- **Token Allocation**:  
  - μCredits: Minted per task completion (70% members, 20% auditors, 10% Builder fund).  
  - Roses: Spent on AI refinements (e.g., flowchart layout optimization).  
- **Staking Mechanisms**:  
  - Bananas staked to “lock” critical tasks/flowcharts for auditability.  
- **Valuation-AI Integration**:  
  - Dynamic pricing for compute-heavy tasks (e.g., GPU Burst jobs).  

---

#### **7. Governance & Compliance Overview**  
**Purpose:** Align with Hapa’s decentralized governance model.  
**Contents:**  
- **Consul Governance**:  
  - Voting thresholds for task/flowchart changes.  
  - DID-based permissions for edits.  
- **Data Ownership**:  
  - Users retain full control over task/flowchart data.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**:  
  - GDPR-ready (right to delete tasks/flowcharts from feeds).  

---

#### **8. Integration Roadmap with Flowchart App**  
**Purpose:** Phased rollout of interconnected features.  
**Contents:**  
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**:  
  - Basic task creation + Hypercore storage.  
  - Manual node-to-task linking in Flowchart app.  
- **Phase 2 (AI Automation)**:  
  - Gatekeeper auto-generates tasks from Flowchart nodes.  
  - μCredit rewards for diagram-to-task conversions.  
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features)**:  
  - Cross-app dependency graphs (WASM-powered analytics).  
  - Consul voting for template standardization.

#### **9. Risk Mitigation Plan**  
**Purpose:** Address technical and adoption risks.  
**Contents:**  
- **Technical Risks**:  
  - Hypercore sync delays → Local caching + conflict resolution.  
  - AI model bias → Federated learning across Consuls.  
- **Adoption Risks**:  
  - User friction with crypto incentives → In-app tutorials.  
  - Sybil attacks → DID-based identity verification.
